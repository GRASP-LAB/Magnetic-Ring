### Abstract
Assemblies of magnetic beads, also called magnetostructures, exhibit interesting mechanical properties,
adapting orientations of the dipoles to minimize the dipolar energy. A ring made of N spherical magnetic beads
behaves like an elastic annulus. This elastic-like property is due to the dipolar nature of the particles. When
submitted to gravity and as a function of its size, the initial circular shape of a magnetic ring is seen to experience
flattening. This capsule-like shape appears when the number N of magnets reaches a critical point scaling with
the Bond number Nf ∝ Bo−1/3. When the number of magnets increases more and more, the ring starts to buckle
and a flat object appears at a second critical point Nz ∝ Bo−1 + b. There, a zipping state corresponding to the
attraction of two opposite sides is formed. We propose a theoretical approach to capture these scaling laws
in agreement with experimental data. All shapes are also numerically obtained in a discrete element model
confirming our findings.
